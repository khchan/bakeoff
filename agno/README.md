# Agno Multi-Agent Financial Planning System

This implementation replicates the semantic-kernel multi-agent system using the [Agno](https://docs.agno.com/) framework with **enhanced session support and conversation history**.

## üîÑ Session Support & Conversation History

The system now includes full session support for multi-turn conversations:

- **Session Management**: Each chat session gets unique user and session IDs
- **Conversation History**: Agents remember previous interactions within the session
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Agents can reference and build upon earlier exchanges
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Support for referencing previous sessions (configurable)
- **Persistent Storage**: Sessions are stored in SQLite database for persistence

### Session Features
- **Memory.v2**: Multi-user, multi-session memory support
- **History Inclusion**: Last 3-5 conversation turns included in agent context
- **Session Search**: Ability to search across previous sessions
- **Storage Persistence**: All sessions saved to `data/sessions.db`

## System Architecture

### Team-Based Orchestration
The system uses Agno's **Team** concept with "coordinate" mode:

- **Team Leader**: Orchestrates task delegation and synthesizes outputs
- **Specialized Agents**: Handle specific domains (member prediction, MQL generation)
- **Shared Context**: Team maintains shared context across member interactions
- **Session Continuity**: Full conversation history maintained across interactions

### Core Components

#### 1. Orchestration Team (`orchestration_team.py`)
- **Role**: Main coordinator using Agno's Team concept
- **Mode**: "coordinate" - delegates tasks and synthesizes outputs
- **Session Support**: Full memory and storage integration
- **Tools**: Model listing and information retrieval
- **Members**: Member Prediction Agent, MQL Agent

#### 2. Member Prediction Agent (`member_prediction_agent.py`)
- **Role**: Translates natural language to OLAP cube members
- **Session Support**: Remembers previous member searches
- **Tools**: VenaTools for cube exploration
- **Context Awareness**: Uses conversation history to avoid repeating work

#### 3. MQL Agent (`mql_agent.py`)
- **Role**: Generates Vena Model Query Language
- **Session Support**: References previous MQL queries
- **Context**: Builds upon earlier member predictions
- **Output**: SQL-like MQL with explanations

#### 4. Model Selection Agent (`model_selection_agent.py`)
- **Role**: Helps select appropriate financial models
- **Session Support**: Maintains model selection consistency
- **Tools**: Model discovery and information retrieval

#### 5. Vena Tools (`vena_tools.py`)
- **Role**: Interface to Vena API functionality
- **Functions**: Model listing, member search, dimension exploration
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with all agents

#### 6. Chat Service (`chat_service.py`)
- **Role**: Centralized configuration management
- **Features**: Azure OpenAI setup, Memory configuration, Storage setup
- **Session Support**: Provides Memory.v2 and SQLite storage

## Session Configuration

### Team-Level Session Settings
```python
# Team configuration (supported parameters)
add_history_to_messages=True     # Include conversation history
num_history_runs=5               # Last 5 conversation turns
memory=get_memory_config()       # Memory.v2 for session support
storage=get_storage_config()     # SQLite storage for persistence
```

### Agent-Level Session Settings
```python
# Individual agent configuration (additional parameters available)
add_history_to_messages=True     # Include conversation history
num_history_runs=3               # Last 3 conversation turns
search_previous_sessions_history=True  # Search across sessions (agents only)
num_history_sessions=2           # Include last 2 sessions (agents only)
memory=get_memory_config()       # Memory.v2 for session support
storage=get_storage_config()     # SQLite storage for persistence
```

### Storage Configuration
```python
# SQLite storage for session persistence
storage = SqliteStorage(
    table_name="agno_sessions",
    db_file="data/sessions.db"
)
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install agno chainlit python-dotenv azure-identity
```

### 2. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file:
```env
# Azure OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_endpoint
OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your_deployment_name  
OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-15-preview

# Vena API Configuration
VENA_API_KEY=your_vena_api_key
VENA_BASE_URL=your_vena_base_url

# Optional: Local Model Override
LOCAL_MODEL_OVERRIDE=false
```

### 3. Run the System
```bash
# Start the Chainlit server
python server.py

# Or use chainlit directly
chainlit run server.py
```

### 4. Session Usage
1. **Start Session**: Each new chat automatically creates a unique session
2. **Continue Conversation**: Ask follow-up questions that reference previous context
3. **Build Upon Results**: Agents remember previous model selections, member searches, and MQL queries
4. **Session Persistence**: Close and reopen - session history is maintained

## Session Examples

### Example 1: Context-Aware Follow-up
```
User: "What is top revenue across all departments in 2022?"
System: [Generates MQL with member predictions]

User: "Now show me the same data for 2023"
System: [References previous model and members, only changes year]
```

### Example 2: Building on Previous Work
```
User: "List available financial models"
System: [Shows models, user selects Model ID 5]

User: "What departments are available in that model?"
System: [Remembers Model ID 5, searches departments]

User: "Generate MQL for sales department revenue"
System: [Uses remembered model and department context]
```

## Session Management

### Session Information
- **Session ID**: Displayed in welcome message and error messages
- **User ID**: Unique identifier for each chat session
- **Storage Location**: `data/sessions.db` (automatically created)
- **History Retention**: Configurable number of turns and sessions

### Session Benefits
1. **Continuity**: No need to repeat model selections or context
2. **Efficiency**: Agents avoid redundant API calls
3. **Context**: Better understanding of user intent over time
4. **Learning**: System builds knowledge within conversation flow

## Technical Implementation

### Session Flow
1. **Initialization**: Generate unique user_id and session_id
2. **Memory Setup**: Configure Memory.v2 with SQLite storage
3. **Agent Configuration**: Enable history inclusion for all agents
4. **Team Coordination**: Maintain shared context across members
5. **Persistence**: Store all interactions for future reference

### Error Handling
- Session information included in error messages
- Graceful fallback when session features unavailable
- Clear troubleshooting guidance with session context

## Comparison with Original

| Feature | Original (Semantic Kernel) | Enhanced (Agno + Sessions) |
|---------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Architecture | Plugin-based orchestration | Team-based coordination + Sessions |
| Memory | Stateless | Multi-session persistent memory |
| Context | Per-request only | Cross-conversation context |
| Agents | Individual plugins | Collaborative team members |
| History | None | Full conversation history |
| User Experience | Repetitive setup | Context-aware continuity |
| Scalability | Limited | Enhanced with session management |

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Session Settings
```python
# Customize memory retention
team = Team(
    memory=Memory(),
    add_history_to_messages=True,
    num_history_runs=10,          # More history
    search_previous_sessions_history=True,
    num_history_sessions=5,       # More sessions
    # ... other settings
)
```

### Production Considerations
- Replace UUID-based user_id with actual authentication
- Configure database connection pooling for high concurrency
- Set up session cleanup/archival processes
- Monitor session storage growth
- Implement user-specific session isolation

## Benefits of Session-Enhanced System

1. **User Experience**: Seamless multi-turn conversations
2. **Efficiency**: Reduced redundant operations  
3. **Context Awareness**: Better understanding of user needs
4. **Scalability**: Multi-user, multi-session support
5. **Persistence**: Conversations survive application restarts
6. **Intelligence**: Agents learn from conversation patterns

The session-enhanced Agno implementation provides a significantly improved user experience while maintaining full compatibility with the original system's functionality.
